# About Botani

Botani is a social network where the main goal is to be a practical platform for users to share their special plants. The focus is keeping track of each plant's growth, with a special timeline feature.

Botani is made by junior developers so they could join practical programming lessons with the idea of creating a personal project to connect people.

## The Growth of Botani

The Botani project was born in 2019 as a final project for the course **Desenvolvimento Full-Stack,** administered by **[Digital House](https://www.digitalhouse.com/br/)** programming school. The project outgrew the course and is now a personal project for its developers.
